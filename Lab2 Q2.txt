 1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

With very few nodes (e.g., 1–3), accuracy is low — the model can’t capture complex decision boundaries.

As hidden units increase (4–20), accuracy improves because the model learns more complex patterns.

Very large hidden layers (e.g., 50) may not give much extra improvement and could lead to overfitting.

2. Pattern of accuracy change:

Small hidden layers → underfitting, low accuracy.

Medium hidden layers → good balance, higher accuracy.

Very large hidden layers → accuracy plateaus or slightly fluctuates due to overfitting.
